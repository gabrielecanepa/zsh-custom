## Usage

Clone the extension you want to your `$ZSH_CUSTOM`:

```shell
ext_name="squanchy" # TODO: change with the wanted extension
ext_type="theme" # TODO: use the correct type
ext_path="${ext_type}s/${ext_name}$([ $ext_type = theme ] && echo .zsh-theme || echo .plugin.zsh)"
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrielecanepa/zsh-custom/master/$ext_path > "$ZSH_CUSTOM/$ext_path"
```

Activate the new plugin/theme in your `~/.zshrc`:

```shell
# ~/.zshrc

ZSH_THEME="squanchy"

plugins=(
  # ...
  gatekeeper
  node-modules
  profile
  # ...
  themes # use it to switch theme with `theme <theme-name>`
)
```
