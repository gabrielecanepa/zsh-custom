## Plugins

For each plugin, print an help message with `<plugin-name> help`.

#### [`profile`](https://github.com/gabrielecanepa/zsh-custom/blob/master/plugins/profile/profile.plugin.zsh) ðŸ‘¤

A powerful plugin to manage your shell profile and configuration files.

**N.B.** To use this plugin you must have a `dotfiles` folder in the specified `Working directory`. The script will create a symbolic link in the right system folder for each file you place in this folder (check the supported formats [here](profile/profile.plugin.zsh#L126-L159)).

#### [`gatekeeper`](https://github.com/gabrielecanepa/zsh-custom/blob/master/plugins/gatekeeper/gatekeeper.plugin.zsh) ðŸ”“

Fixes in most cases the `App is damaged and canâ€™t be opened. You should move it to the Trash` error message by disabling Gatekeeper, a macOS security feature blocking the installation of applications downloaded from unidentified developers.

#### [`node_modules`](https://github.com/gabrielecanepa/zsh-custom/blob/master/plugins/node-modules/node_modules.plugin.zsh) ðŸ‘€

The modules stored in your `node_modules` folders can take a lot of space for unused projects. This small script lists the [Node.js](nodejs.org) modules by size and deletes them.
